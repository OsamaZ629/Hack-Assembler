# Hack-Assembler
An implementation of the Hack machine language assembler in java. Followed from the book "The Elements of Computing Systems."

# Issues
 - Bad Exception names.
 - Needs better parsing. The assembler can translate a correctly written asm file with no issues, but it may translate a file with syntax errors without throwing an error.
